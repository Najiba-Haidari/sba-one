## Description

In this Skill-based Assessment, you will be creating a small three-page website. The topic and content of your website is entirely up to you – be creative!
Your work will be graded based on the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity always works in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have time.
Since this is likely your first time creating a website, keep it simple. Keeping it simple ensures that you can complete this project within the given time. Like most projects you’ll encounter, you should finish the absolute requirements first, and then add complexity if you have time. This also gives you a better idea of what you can get done in the given time if you were to do it again with more requirements.
Once you have your website idea, approach your design with the user’s perspective in mind. User experience is one of the most important aspects of good web design. If users enjoy their time on your site, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and visit again.
